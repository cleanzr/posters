# Posters for Entity Resolution 

This repository contains posters that can be used for others to use regarding guidance when creating their own posters
for conferences, workshops, etc. 

1. You need to install  a0poster: https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/a0poster?lang=en. This is a library in latex in order to run this part:  \documentclass[portrait,a0,final]{a0poster}
 
If you have already a0poster then:

2. Because the poster structure uses some particular commands in order to create a pdf you need to run the following commands depending on what operating system you are using or if you are using the command line. 

I recommend that you try combinations of a--c until you are able to compile the .tex for the poster. 

a. latex to dvi to PS to pdf

b. xelatex

c. tex to ps2pdf
